# Zomato Restaurant Analysis

The data set consists of columns like Restaurant name, Cuisine, City, Country, Rating, etc.

The main aim of this project is to answer questions like:

  1. Most Expensive/Highly Rated Cuisine
  2. Average Ratings of Different Cuisines/Cities/Countries
  3. Most Expensive/Highly Rated Restaurants
  4. Factors affecting Restuarant Ratings
  5. Highly Rated cuisine apart from the local cuisine
  
This project answers many other insightful questions with the help of statistical plots like correlation graphs, heatmaps, box and whisker plots, etc.

The project is still going on.
